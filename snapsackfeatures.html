<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3"><p>The SnapSack is, at its most basic, a backpack.<br>
What makes it special is that you won't have to think twice about preparing for a toke break&mdash; the SnapSack has everything you&rsquo;ll need or want. </p>
</div>

<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3"><p>It has built&ndash;in speakers.<br>
It was built&ndash;in wifi. </p>
</div>

<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3"><p>It comes with a glass pipe and papers. <br>
You&rsquo;ll never run out of fire because it comes with 5 lighters and a back&ndash;up pack of matches. </p>
</div>

<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3"><p>Do your eyes get red? The SnapSack comes with eyedrops. <br>
Worried about smelling like stale smoke? The SnapSack sack comes with body and linen spray that smells like laundry. It also comes with gum to freshen your breath. </p>
</div>

<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3"><p>At SnapSack, we know how important it is to quench your thirst and feed your munchies&mdash; the SnapSack comes with 3 cans of Peace Tea and an assortment of snacks (some crunchy, some chewy, some salty, some sweet). It even comes with a thermal chamber so you can bring ice cream on the go (or keep your bong water ice cold).</p>

<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3"><p>If you&rsquo;re out on an adventure, you&rsquo;ll be happy to find all these things in your SnapSack...Plus, you&rsquo;ll find all sorts of entertainment too&mdash; a hackysack, a frisbee (also makes a great rolling tray), pens and paper...</p>
