<h2>&#9352; Persona</h2>

<p>Name&#58; Cooper</p>

<p>Age&#58; 16</p>

<p>Gender&#58; Woman</p>

<p>Tag line&#58; High school student preparing for higher education.</p>

<p>Experience level with feminist ideology&#58; Cooper knows something isn&rsquo;t right about the social dynamics of the high school setting but doesn&rsquo;t have the language to describe it. </p>

<p>Context for interaction with feminist blog, usage, device, etc&#58; Cooper would interact with my personal website because she is interested in learning about feminism, anti&ndash;racism, and social justice. Because this work never ends, she will likely desire to access the site fairly often, especially if she needs to prepare rebuttals to sexist, racist, or homophobic remarks. Because she wants to be able to immediately access sources to help articulate her feminist identity and the importance of feminism, she needs access on both her home computer and smart phone.</p>

<p>Goals and concerns when using blog&#58; The blog needs to load fast so Cooper can learn fast. The blog needs to provide other sources of information so she can explore the feminist arena of the web. The blog should be aesthetically pleasing. It should include easy access to articles, books, art, poetry, images, music, screencaps, blogs, videos, and other forms of popular media.</p>

<p>Quotes to summarize persona&rsquo;s attitude&#58; &ldquo;Everyone has nipples.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>&#9353; Content</h2>

I would like my personal website to act as a social justice r&eacute;sum&eacute; that exemplifies my feminist anti&ndash;racist ideology and also provides resources for others to utilize and become familiar with feminism and social justice activism. I would like it to include original creative and scholarly works, links to my social medias (excluding facebook), and other resources and images. I'm essentially describing my tumblr. 

<h2>&#9354; Fave Five Sites</h2>

<a href="http://ianenders.com/" title="ianenders.com">ianenders.com</a>

<p>I like this personal site because it includes a picture of the person, everything is on one page, it&rsquo;s poetic and funny, accessible, aesthetic, and provides external links. The color scheme is basic and easy to look at and the links are easy to navigate. </p>

<a href="http://www.alexafalcone.com/" title="alexafalcone.com">alexafalcone.com</a>

<p>I like this personal site because it looks like Tumblr&#59; simple, not busy, easy to navigate. All the colors and rectangular images fit well together. When you hover over the images, there is a simple explanation of what the project is and what type of project it is. It&rsquo;s pretty. I appreciate that you can &ldquo;x&rdquo; out of a project after you click on it from anywhere in your scrolling. </p>

<a href="http://colly.com/" title="colly.com">colly.com</a>

<p>I like this personal site because it is uniform. The color scheme is simple and elegant, and I like the sketches of animals. I like that when you click on the boxes at the top of his site, they open up nicely within the page instead of an external link. </p>

<a href="http://marieguillaumet.com/blog/" title="marieguillaumet.com">marieguillaumet.com</a>

<p>I like this personal site because it looks crafty and hand&ndash;made. The colors are subtle. There are a few different fonts that go well together. There are illustrations and links that look like buttons. There are lots of square and rectangular images and text boxes that fit very well together. Her site is very blog&ndash;y and friendly. </p>

<a href="http://sahillavingia.com/" title="sahillavingia.com">sahillavingia.com</a>

<p>I like this personal site because it is plain. It provides a literal timeline with links to his company. </p>
