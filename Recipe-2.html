	<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

		<p>I swear buttermilk is magic. I&rsquo;ve dwelled on this before. Buttermilk seems to turn everything to gold. Super&ndash;moist, super&ndash;delicious gold.</p>

		<p>Anyway, I needed a simple, summery, breakfasty, cake&ndash;like&ndash;but&ndash;not&ndash;dessert&ndash;like recipe to make this morning. One of Ben&rsquo;s friends had crashed here last night, and I thought it only appropriate to treat him to a proper breakfast. In other words, I was craving sugar and carbs. The truth is I&rsquo;ve been craving sugar and carbs and a cake like this for months. But seriously, who doesn&rsquo;t crave having a good, seasonal, berry cake recipe in their morning&ndash;treat repertoire&#63;</p>

		<p>Nobody. And I think I&rsquo;ve found the recipe that fits the bill. On an old photocopied sheet of paper in my mother&rsquo;s hand writing, I spotted a note: &ldquo;Baby Boy&rsquo;s Favorite.&rdquo; Oh Baby Boy. Baby Boy is my younger brother, my parents&rsquo; favorite child, and one of the most satisfying people to cook for. If it was Baby Boy&rsquo;s favorite cake, it would soon be mine, too. This cake is delectable&#33; I think you&rsquo;ll like it, too.</p>

			<li>Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F. Cream butter with lemon zest and &frac34; cup of the sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
